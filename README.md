2 csv files - [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather?select=weather_features.csv):
- Energy dataset:   contains 4 years (2014-2018) of hourly electrical consumption, generation and pricing in Spain.
- Wheather dataset: contains 4 years (2014-2018) of hourly whether measurments in 5 cities in Spain: Madrid, Valencia, Bilbao, Barcelona and Seville.

## Hypothesis : Weather factors affect energy consumption and generation, which affect energy prices.


Data Exploration:

Eneregy
- Energy demand prices seem to drop in spring time and rise around the peaks of the summer and winter.
- Total Energy demand seem to drop in spring and autumn, and to rise in winter and summer.

Wheather: 
- Cities are distribution is relatively wide, therefore we will assume that the weather of all of Spain can be represented by these cities.
- All cities have similar number of measurements.
